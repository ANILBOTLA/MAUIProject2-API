Conclusion: -
In this project we developed simple exercise page for young kids to play simple calculations and we should also add elements are (addition, subtraction, etc.,) and we also made some clickable buttons for users to choose (if the message is correct its directly navigated to next exercise automatically. However, if it displays incorrect it shows two buttons for “Try Again” and “Skip to Next”).
Thank you!
